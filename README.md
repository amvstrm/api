# amvstrm's API

> This is the final development of the API, and we will also be sunsetting the domain and the entire project.

This is the bun version of amvstrm/API using Elysia.js. The app is still in development and is not ready for production use and Some have not been tested properly.

## Installation

You need to have Bun installed on your computer. If you don't have it, install it from the website [Bun](https://bun.sh).

After that clone our API from the bun branch repository, install the dependencies, and run the app.

```bash
bun run dev 
```

## Docker

We need help for dockerfile configuration, so if you want to use this API in docker, you can help us creating dockerfile by creating a new pull request.
